## Motivation

Set up and test AspectJ with maven to use it in complex projects.
Maybe this project will evolve into a web application which logs
or apply metrics with aspects.

## Compile & run

From the **parent directory**:

`mvn clean install`

Then go to the **service directory**:

`mvn exec:java`
